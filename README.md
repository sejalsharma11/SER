# SER
Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) is the task of automatically identifying the emotional state of a speaker based on their speech signals. Given the audio recordings of speech, the goal is to classify the emotional state of the speaker into predefined categories such as happiness, sadness, anger, etc. The aim of this research is to develop accurate and efficient algorithms for speech emotion recognition, which can reliably classify the emotional state of speakers in real-world scenarios.

This portion of the RAVDESS contains 1440 files: 60 trials per actor x 24 actors = 1440. The RAVDESS contains 24 professional actors (12 female, 12 male), vocalizing two lexically-matched statements in a neutral North American accent. Speech emotions includes calm, happy, sad, angry, fearful, surprise, and disgust expressions. Each expression is produced at two levels of emotional intensity (normal, strong), with an additional neutral expression.

emotions = {1 : "neutral", 2 : "calm", 3 : "happy", 4 : "sad", 5 : 'angry',6 : "fearful", 7 : "disgust", 8 : "surprise"}
